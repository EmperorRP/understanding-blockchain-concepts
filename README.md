# Basics of blockchain in layman terms
(Blockchain Theory) and protocols such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, liquidity pools, DEXs, Block construction, TX propagation and mempool, Nodes and clients, other EVM blockchains, AMMs, lending, collateral, staking, and DeFi protocols

This repo is supposed to be a blog style repo explaining blockchain concepts in a simple manner, in my own terms. Star this repo if you find it useful!

## What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is a token, it is a token that can be used like normal currency but through the internet, worldwide. It is a technology that is powered by blockchain. It uses cryptography to carry out secure transactions digitally. 

## What is blockchain?
Like the name says, it is a chain of blocks. Every block consists of transactions and tracks assets. It is a database that is shared across all the nodes connected to the blockchain. Blockchain is mainly used for security and openness of transactions.
PS: haters call it is a glorified global linked list 

## How is a block constructed?
The goal of a blockchain is to expand itself by adding more blocks at the end. At the end, once a block is added, it is difficult to change the blockchain contents and state of the previous blocks unless a common consensus has been achieved. Depending on the protocol, this is how the next block is constructed: 

1. __PoW or Proof of Work__
> If miners solve a complex math problem with the help of cryptography. Once solved, the block is available for transactions and the miner is rewarded with cryptocurrency. 

2. __PoS or Proof of Stake__
> Based on an individualâ€™s stake, a validator is chosen at random and makes cryptocurrency transactions to add a new block to the blockchain. Much more cost efficient and energy efficient than PoW.
